PANDORA'S BOX AUTO CONFLICT CHECKER
------------------------------------
v1.0.0 completed May 13, 2022

AUTHOR: Danny Picazo

This program reads through the teaming checklist responses excel sheet and
saves all the responses. The program allows you to create a team of two or more
and it will automatically check if there are any conflicts. 

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
-----------------------
JAR FILE: Download the excel responses as a .tsv then rename the file to 'responses.tsv' and
place it in the same folder/directory as the .jar file. You can then proceed to run the .jar file. 

CODE (for smelly coders): You want to run TeamGUI.java. Since the project is not in a package, you want
to ensure that all the files are in the same folder. Open CMD in the current directory, then proceed to run
'javac TeamGUI.java' and then run it with 'java TeamGUI'.
